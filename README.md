# HW3 Random Password Generator

## Description

For this project I had to create a password generator. My motivation for the project was to provide a solution to create a strong password for users. Throughout the creation of this generator I sharped my javascript skills regarding loops and if statements. I also honed in my trouble shooting skills.

## Creation

In order to make this password generator work, I had to create the criteria for the password and I had to make a function that pulled the characters. I first made if and else statements that guided the user on what characters their password would have using confirm and prompts. I then recorded that input and put it in a function that pulled the correct criteria and displayed it on the screen with a return.
